Introducing EC2 Hibernate:

The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
The instance boot is much faster!
Under the hood: THE RAM STATE IS WRITTEN TO A FILE IN THE ROOT EBS VOLUME
The root EBS volume must be encrypted



USE CASES:

long running processing
Saving the RAM State
Services that take time to initialize
